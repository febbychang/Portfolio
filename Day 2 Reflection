Today if I had more time, I would change something about the program I made today because I wanted it to be more 
user interactive and make it more user friendly. I want the program to be able to help people within their everyday 
lives and not just a program that will not help anyone at all. Tomorrow I would need someone to continuously teach me 
every time I am extremely lost and confused.
