A list is a variable that has multiple elements and it's useful in that
  we can use them to help us list different elements in order for better understanding 
  of a certain element. 
  the group that worked the best was my friend because we were able to fix our syntax errors
  and bugs together and try to figure out how to make these lists and functions and colors 
  work on modifying a picture.
