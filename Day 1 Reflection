1. I really liked my instructors in that they were all extremely fun, caring and loving. I would change the amount of time spent in front of the computer in that throughout the day we shouldn't be glued in front of the computer. And we may be able to relax ourselves by maybe having a conversation with each other and buy the ball Wilson from the movie castaway. ðŸ˜… 
2. My teachers should know that I am an extremely big animal especially dog lover and it will help me get better in this program by doing more dog related projects. 

3. I am most exited to learn about my teachers and classmates and how to code especially and set up maybe a security system for my own personal items. 

4. I think a computer scientist is someone who experiments with software programs and introducing them to others by creating new ones.
