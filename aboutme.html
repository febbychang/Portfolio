<li> 
Some similarities between Python and Scratch is that
they all use the same functions but python is manually 
put in by text based and scratch is already all 
inputted into the function already. Some differences 
are that one is manually typed and the other is not manually typed. 
</li>

Debugging my program took a lot of effort in that we had to figure out 
where all of the problems were showing up within the python code and had to 
go word by word to find the error. I like that we are learning to become more 
careful when writing code but the hard thing was that some code was so hard to find the error
in in that it was not very easy to find the source of error.

 Lesson 8

 <li>
 A list is a variable that has multiple elements and it's useful in that
  we can use them to help us list different elements in order for better understanding 
  of a certain element. 
  <br>
  the group that worked the best was my friend because we were able to fix our syntax errors
  and bugs together and try to figure out how to make these lists and functions and colors 
  work on modifying a picture.
